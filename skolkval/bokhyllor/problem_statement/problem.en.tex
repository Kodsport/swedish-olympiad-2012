\problemname{Book Shelves}
You are going to buy book shelves to put all your books in.
You already know how many books you have and need to count the number of book shelves required.
The books have three sizes: a small book has width $1$, a medium book width $2$ and a big book width $3$.
Each shelf has the same given width.

Given the number of books you have of each kind, write a program to compute the minimum number of shelves needed.

\section*{Input}
The first line contains three integers that, in order, describe the number of small books, the number of medium books and the number of big books.
There will be at most $20$ books of each kind.

The second line contains the integer $S$ ($S \le 20$), the width of a single shelf.
You will always need at least $2$ shelves.

\section*{Output}
Print the minimum number of shelves that you need to fit all the books.

\section*{Grading}
Your program will be tested on three test cases.
The first two are each worth $33$ points.
The last one is worth $34$ points.

In the cases worth $33$ points, the number of books is at most $25$ and the shelf has width at most $10$.
