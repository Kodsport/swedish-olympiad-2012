\problemname{Lighthouses}
\noindent

We have a square grid consisting of $n \times n$ cells. There are $m$ lighthouses placed on the grid.
Initially, all lighthouses are "off," but when you turn one on, all other lighthouses sharing the same
$x$ or $y$ coordinate with the already lit lighthouse will also turn on, and this continues recursively.
You can turn on $k$ lighthouses, and because you hate darkness, your goal is to light as many lighthouses
as possible by the end. How many lighthouses can you get to light up?

\section*{Input}
The first line of input contains the integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \leq m \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \leq k \leq m$).

The following $m$ lines each contain the integer coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$ for each lighthouse, satisfying $0 \le x_i, y_i < n$.
There is at most one lighthouse per cell. You may not assume that the lighthouses are uniformly distributed.

\section*{Output}
Print an integer: the maximum number of lighthouses you can light up if you turn on at most $k$ of them.


\section*{Points}
Your solution will be tested on several test case groups.
To get the points for a group, it must pass all the test cases in the group.
